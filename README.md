# workbench
Workbench started out as a way to manage several web pages under one site and as a way to avoid rewriting boiler plate html and css everytime I wanted to try out a different layout or color/font scheme for those pages. Additionally I can set the status of any page so that it doesn't show to the public but only to logged in users of a given user group. This helps with "pages in progress" - pages that I want to be able to see how it's progressing and how it looks in the website but I don't want the public to have access to yet. I could say that the workbench framework has evolved into a code base for a content management system - but it's really not that. It's just a simple framework that lets me rapidly develope a site that has lots of managed content. The framework doesn't actually provide any content management capabilities over than to preserve links while I manually move stuff around to my liking. It's up here on github because I needed a place to backup the code and the version control is a nice feature that's made it a little easier to manage a project that keeps growing in scope. It's available to the public because I'm to cheap to pay for a private account.
