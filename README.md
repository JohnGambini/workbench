# workbench
Workbench started out as a way to manage several web pages under one site and as a way to avoid rewriting boiler plate html and css everytime I wanted to tryout a different layout or color/font scheme for those pages. It's evolved into what I have the audacity to call a content management code base. This is a pre-release because to date the focus has been on presenting the data using various pages - that is - the focus has been on layout and color schemes. Later versions will gradually include more and more features that integrate workbench into the current web social eco-system.
